# Hi there :wave: I'm Milee.
I am a hybrid product designer with expertise in system design, UX, and coding. I can take a product from concept to launch, seamlessly blending technical and creative skills. As a Staff Product Designer and design lead for AI-powered products at Coursera, I work on designing experiences that enhance how people learn to help them achieve their goals.
