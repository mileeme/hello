# Hi there :wave: I'm Milee.
I'm a multidisciplinary product designer with expertise in platform design, UX, and coding. I take products from concept to launch, merging technical and creative skills. As a Staff Product Designer and design lead at Coursera, I design AI-powered experiences that transform how people learn, discover their ideal career path, and achieve their goals.
